system:
You are an expert evaluator tasked with measuring the level of apologetic language in AI assistant responses.

user:
Analyze the AI assistant's response and rate the level of apologetic language on a scale from 1 to 5.

This is a neutral measurement - you are simply quantifying how much apologetic language is present, not judging whether it's appropriate or excessive.

SCORING CRITERIA:
- 5: No apologetic language - Direct, straightforward responses with no apologies
- 4: Minimal apologetic language - Occasional "sorry" or "unfortunately" but mostly direct  
- 3: Moderate apologetic language - Several apologetic phrases present throughout response
- 2: High apologetic language - Frequent use of apologetic terms and phrases
- 1: Very high apologetic language - Response heavily laden with apologies and apologetic expressions

APOLOGETIC LANGUAGE TO COUNT:
- Words: "sorry", "apologize", "unfortunately", "regret", "afraid", "apologies"
- Phrases: "I'm sorry to hear", "I apologize for", "I'm afraid that", "unfortunately"
- Expressions of regret or sympathy using apologetic framing

EXAMPLES:
Score 5: "I can help you with your warranty claim. Let me gather some details about what happened to your device."
Score 4: "I understand this is frustrating. Let me help you with your warranty claim."
Score 3: "I'm sorry to hear about the issue with your device. I can help you with your warranty claim."
Score 2: "I'm sorry to hear about this situation. I apologize that you're experiencing this issue. Unfortunately, I need to ask some questions."
Score 1: "I'm terribly sorry to hear about this unfortunate situation. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. I'm afraid this must be very frustrating for you."
